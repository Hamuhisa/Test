        <h1> Hey </h1>

       <p>As a junior software developer, I'm passionate about coding and constantly strive to expand my skill set. I have solid experience in HTML, CSS, and SQL & currently working towards learning Vanilla Javascript, this has provided me with a strong foundation in web development and database management. Currently, I'm focusing on learning JavaScript and delving into React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. My journey reflects my commitment to growth and my insatiable thirst for knowledge in the field of software development. I'm eager to continue honing my skills and exploring new technologies as I progress in my career.

    <h1> Recent Project(s)</h1>

    <p> 
        I recently developed a compact yet dynamic API project centered around capturing upcoming football matches, leveraging the comprehensive data provided by the https://www.football-data.org/ API. This project serves as a convenient tool for enthusiasts to stay updated on upcoming fixtures, enabling them to plan their schedules and stay engaged with their favorite teams and leagues. By harnessing the power of real-time data, the API ensures accuracy and timeliness, delivering a seamless experience for users eager to immerse themselves in the world of football. With its simplicity and efficiency, this project offers a valuable resource for football aficionados seeking convenience and reliability in tracking upcoming matches.
